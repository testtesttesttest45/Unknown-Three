## Overview

Unknown Three is a card game made for mobile devices. It features real time multiplayer played by 4 players.

It features cards 1 to 10, with King, Queen, Jack, Fiend, Skip. There are also rare fun cards; the Zero card and Golden Jack.

The goal of Unknown Three is to end the game with the least score among all players. The game ends when there are no more cards in the Main Deck.

In this game mode, each player starts with 3 cards placed in front of them faced down, side by side.

Players can take a peek at their own left and right cards.

On a player’s turn, he can draw a card from the Main Deck. After looking at the card’s value, he can choose to replace with one if his existing 3 cards, or he can Discard. Cards in Waste Pile are always face-up.

If he replaces the new card with one of his existing cards, the original card would go to the Waste Pile, while the new card will replace that spot.

If he discards the new card instead, the new card goes to the Waste Pile.

Players do not necessary need to always draw cards from the Main Deck. They have another choice; picking cards from the Waste Pile, but they can only pick up the card on the top of the pile, provided that card is not marked as killed. With the card picked up, the player will need to replace with one of his existing cards. This means that when a player picks up a card from Waste Pile, everyone else would know the card value and position.

Face cards have unique abilities. Their abilities can only be activated if players draw from the Main Deck and discard the face card.

- **Jack**: Reveals 1 card of any player for yourself.  
  Additional ability: Alerts every player if a card with value 0 is detected. Won’t expose if you activated the Jack and have a Zero in your hand.
- **Queen**: Swaps the position of 2 cards belonging to anyone
- **King**: Kills 1 card of any player. Killed card will go to the Waste Pile but with an exception: It cannot be picked up by anyone as it has been marked as killed. Thereafter, a new card from the Main Deck will be placed at the position where the card was killed
- **Fiend**: Jumble up any player’s cards.  
  Additional ability: If a Fiend is killed by a King, the Fiend will jumble up the cards of whoever killed him
- **Skip**: Skips the next player’s turn
- **Golden Jack**: Reveals all hand card of any player for yourself.  
  Additional ability: If a Golden Jack is killed by a King, the Golden Jack will reveal all hand card of whoever killed him to everyone. The killer won’t be able to see the revelation. Golden Jack cannot be killed, but can still be sent to Waste Pile by the King
- **Nemesis**: Curses a card of any player permanently. No one else knows the card that was cursed and can only see which player had the cursed card. Cursed cards have value doubled
- **Scout**: See total card points data of every player. If kept in hands, passively siphon total card points data of every players except yourself
